Data Journalism

An examination of health survey results across the United States and Puerto Rico. The chart compares the percent of the total population, percent of males, or
the percent of females between the ages of 25 and 29 to the results of a health survey. The demographics can be compared to the percent of the population saying
they were in excellent health, good health, or poor health.

The chart was created using D3 and javascript using an html template and an iframe to present the data.

All html files can be found in the skeleton folder, with the data/js/css files all located in various subfolders in assets.
